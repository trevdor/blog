title: Notes on React Lifecycle Methods
date: '2018-06-19T18:19:47.000Z'

A living distillation of all React lifecycle recommendations I have encountered.
 Mostly, but not all, from the React core team at Facebook.

Intended as quick reference usage notes, not a duplicate of the descriptions of
these methods in [the official docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html).

Notes are organized to mirror the modern React lifecycle diagram [Dan Abramov
tweeted](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/981712092611989509)  in April
2018. All sources are annotated so you can fact-check me.

## Render Phase
Pure and has no side effects. May be paused, aborted or restarted by React.

### getDerivedStateFromProps
Most components do not need getDerivedStateFromProps  [^1][^2]

 * Should be a pure function of props and state [^1]
 * No manual DOM mutations here [^1]
 * Do not assume it only fires on prop changes [^3]
 * The three use cases for getDerivedStateFromProps are: [^4] 
    1. Memoization. We
       have a better model for how this should work in the future.
    2. Avoiding the
       need to derive the same value repeatedly in multiple methods/lifecycles.
       (Similar to the problem that defaultProps solves.) Again, our future
       model handles this better.
    3. Reacting to prop
       changes. This is the weird one, and I don't think we totally understand
       yet what the best practices should be.
   
### render

1. should be a pure function of props and state [^1]

---

## Pre-Commit Phase
Can read the DOM.

### getSnapshotBeforeUpdate

---

## Commit Phase  
Can work with DOM, run side effects, schedule updates.

### componentDidMount
 * manual DOM mutations belong here or inside componentDidUpdate  [1:4]

### componentDidUpdate
 * manual DOM mutations belong here or inside componentDidMount  [1:5]
 * careful with setState hereâ€”could trigger an infinite loop

### componentWillUnmount
